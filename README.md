I first established the HTML using bootstrap for my buttons and overall formatting on the page. 
I then added the script.js to the page. 
I used a minimal amount of CSS and styled my page using the javascript commands that called the CSS. 
I used a weather app API to grab the weather from each city
I then used an Ajax call to grab the request from the API. 
I needed to make three different Ajax calls to the API for the daily weather, uv index and the weekly forecast. 
I added the weather icon found in the weather API. 
I used JQuery functions to create new tags to be applied each time the user enter a new city
I used local storage to add the city each time a city is requested.
